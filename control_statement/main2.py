# Note: All questions are based on user input.

# Write a Python program to check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11 or not, in the range between number1 and number2  return in list take user Input    .

# no1 = int(input("Enter the no :"))
# no2 = int(input("Enter the no :"))

# list1=[]

# for no in range(no1,no2+1):
#     if no % 5 == 0 and no % 11 == 0 :
#         list1.append(no)
# print("the no is :",list1)

# Write a Python program to check whether a number is even or odd, in the range between number1 and number2 return in set for odd and even numbers take user Input.
# no1=int(input("Enter the starting no :"))
# no2=int(input("Enter the ending index :"))

# EvenNo =[]
# OddNo=[]

# for i in range(no1,no2+1):
#     if i % 2 == 0 :
#         EvenNo.append(i)
#     else:
#         OddNo.append(i)
# print("Even numbers is ",EvenNo)
# print("Odd Numbers is :",OddNo)
# Write a Python program to find leap years between startYear and EndYear return in a list for leap year and return list in ordinary year take user Input .


# year=int(input("Enter the Starting year :"))
# Year=int(input("Enter the Ending Year :"))

# leap_year=[]
# not_leap_year=[]

# for i in range(year,Year+1):
#     if (i % 4 == 0 and i % 100 !=0 ) or (i % 400 ==0 ) :
#         leap_year.append(i)
#     else:
#         not_leap_year.append(i)
# print("leap_year is : ",leap_year)


# # Write a Python program to input any character and check whether it is an alphabet, digit, or special character.
# inp=input("Enter the char :")

# if inp.isalpha():
#     print("This is alphabate")
# elif inp.isdigit() :
#     print("This is digit")
# else:
#     print("this is special char ")


# Write a Python program to input marks of five subjects (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics, and Computer). Calculate the percentage and grade according to the following criteria:

#                         Percentage >= 90% : Grade A
#                         Percentage >= 80% : Grade B
# 			Percentage >= 70% : Grade C
# 			Percentage >= 60% : Grade D      
# 			Percentage >= 40% : Grade E
# 			Percentage < 40% : Grade F

# A
# B   C
# D   E   F 
# G   H   I  J



# Write a Python program to print multiplication table of a given number using a loop.
